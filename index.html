        Could this woman in L‘atelier (...) be reading aloud to the group? Does
        this present a case for collective feminist teaching and learning, and
        the circulation of ideas?

        <i>La Femme Libre</i><br />
        The first socially conscious French feminist journal aimed at improving
        women‘s employment conditions and was written and published only by
        women. The names credited to the founder and director were
        Jeanne-Désirée Véret Gay and Marie-Reine Guindorf. Both were recent
        activists in the Workers‘ College of the Saint-Simonian movement which
        women broke away from after 1831, forming a range of feminist movements
        as a result. Apostolat des femmes ( A Call to Women) was the title of
        the first issue; with the female contributors passionately calling out
        to all women to join their emancipation cause.In their writing, the
        founders recognise that women are educated to believe in the conventions
        that oppress them, but urge them to join their cause; forming a
        collective in association, understanding, deep feeling, and an
        organisation „that allowed them to indulge in something big“

      <i class="text__question text2__question">
        Did Philippe-Jacques paint this as a record of these rarely seen ladies
        in free autonomous activity, and this rare occurrence of nudity?
      </i>
      <p class="text__paragraph text2__paragraph">
        A tactic some women developed to access a nude figure was to draw
        themselves, using their own bodies as an available tool. Indeed, the
        genre of self-portraits by women artists is one that we can look towards
        at this time in art history for guidance. Women were already depicting
        them-selves, revealing curiosity through pictorial representation,
        exploring first hand their identities and reflecting on their place in
        the world. In these self-portraits we are faced with direct
        confrontations with women: in the presence of all their qualities and
        personas. You see, women are inventive, adaptable, savvy and
        resourceful. They have taken their disadvantage into their own hands,
        defying attitudes about feminine propriety, championing women as
        suitable subjects, and teaching themselves the skills they need to
        succeed.
